# Movie Review Sentiment Classifier

The model has been trained using the [IMDB dataset obtained from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews/download). [Pretrained word embeddings from GloVe](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip) were used with 2 LSTM layers to predict 0 for negative review and 1 for a positive one. 

The whole model was trained in Python (using Notebook in Colab). Keras was used primarily with Tensorflow backend.

***Note:** This was an individual project done for learning purpose and several blogs were referred in the process.*
